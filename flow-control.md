## Flow Control
- change the directioin of execution of a program
- make decisions
- run part of code multiple times
- stop the execution of a part of code

### if conditional
- you can omit the curly brackets if there is only one expression in the block
```
if (number % 2 === 0)
    isEven = 'is even'
else
    isEven = 'is odd'
```
- shorthand: you can put the expression on a single line if there are no curly brackets
```
if (number % 2 === 0) isEven = 'is even' else isEven = 'is odd'
```
- if conditional can return a result
```
val isEven = if (number % 2 === 0) 'is even' else 'is odd'
```

### expressions

#### arithmetic expressions
- in conditional statements we can use any logical expression
- in key word checks whether value is in a collection
```
"cat" in listOf("dog", "cat") // true
```
#### logical expressions

#### ranges

#### in and !inkeywords

### When condetional

### For loops

### while loops
