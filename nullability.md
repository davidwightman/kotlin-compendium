## Nullability

### Null value

- no value present, variable does not exist
- if you use a variable with a null value, your program will crash with a NullPointerException (NPE)
- kotlin guards against null values
- kotlin differentiates between variable that can be null and those that cannot using the ? operator
```
val herName: String = "Lilly"
val hisName: String? = null
```

### null operators

### elvis operator

### non-null assertions
